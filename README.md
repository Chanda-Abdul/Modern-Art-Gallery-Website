## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript Framework
- [React Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) - Interactive Map Library
- Sass/CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This is my first project using [React Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). I really enjoyed working with <b>Styled Components</b> because they helped me organize my CSS styles, and incorporate responsiveness
- This is also one of the first projects where I used <b>Sass</b>. Sass is great, because I created resuable variables for fonts, colors, etc.

  - The given <b>Figma</b> specs for colors
    ![](./screens/colors.png)
  - And the <b>Sass/CSS</b> I came up with

    ````
    :root {
    /* color palette */
    --gold: hsl(24, 56%, 63%);
    --almost-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    --almost-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 27%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    }
    ````

  - The given <b>Figma</b> specs for fonts
    ![](./screens/fonts.png)
  - And the <b>Sass/CSS</b> I came up with

    ````
    /* fonts */
    @mixin heading-xl {
    font-family: "Big Shoulders Display", cursive;
    font-size: 96px;
    line-height: 88px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    @mixin heading-l {
    font-family: "Big Shoulders Display", cursive;
    font-size: 70px;
    line-height: 70px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    @mixin heading-m {
    font-family: "Big Shoulders Display", cursive;
    font-size: 60px;
    line-height: 50px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    @mixin heading-s {
    font-family: "Big Shoulders Display", cursive;
    font-size: 36px;
    line-height: 36px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    @mixin body-m {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 300;
    font-size: 22px;
    line-height: 32px;
    }
    @mixin body-s {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 300;
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 28px;
    }

    /* mobile */
    .title {
    @include heading-m;
    }
    ````

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
````

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would like to Review Social Media Icon active state color change. Maybe add some additional pages.
