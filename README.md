![Design preview for the Art gallery website solution coding challenge](./screens/preview.jpg)

## Summary
This is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge to recreate the [Modern Art Gallery  website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/art-gallery-website).  Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

I built this project to practice my react skills.

## Overview

### Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
  - [x] Mobile First

  - [x] Desktop
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
  - [x] Buttons
  - [ ] Social Media Icons
- [x] **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I would like to Review Social Media Icon active state color change.  Maybe add some additional pages.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
